I found that the player present at every single loss to be Mylie Schmidt. She was present all 13 times.
--
The dealers present at the losses were Cleveland Hanna, Abigale Rich, Chyna Mercado, and Katey Bean who were present for 3, 3, 5, and 2 losses respectively.
--
There is no major outlying correlation between Mylie and a single Dealer, and all dealers present during these losses were working standard, predictable shift patters. I conclude that the likeliness of fixing amongst all 5 parties to be slim to none.
